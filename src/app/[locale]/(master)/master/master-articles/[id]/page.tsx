              We interviewed Mr Mark Khan, the Director of Marketing and
              Enrollment at Boston University Graduate School of Arts and
              Sciences, and asked him about the current graduate school
              application trends, and what advice he can offer to prospective
              students.

            <p>
              Here all of the helpful application tips we talked about in the
              interview.

              What universities expect from students
            </h2>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Universities actively engage with students to encourage them
                  to submit applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Students then make efforts to persuade the universities to
                  accept their applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once accepted, universities continue their engagement efforts
                  to retain the students in their programs.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              The university-student relationship during the recruitment phase
              can be seen as a continuous cycle of mutual persuasion and
              engagement. Both parties actively participate in this process,
              with universities trying to attract potential students and
              students working hard to secure their place.

              Competition for limited program spots means students have to put
              more effort in standing out
            </h2>
            <p>
              As a student, youre no longer just competing with a neighbor down
              the street â€“ you're competing with students from all over the
              world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              What's more, as students have gotten savvier: they know what
              answers schools are looking for in order to get those acceptance
              letters, and theyâ€™re applying to way more schools (3-5 before, and
              7-10 on average today) to increase their chances of getting
              accepted.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            This all means that as a student, itâ€™s very important to differentiate yourself in some way.
