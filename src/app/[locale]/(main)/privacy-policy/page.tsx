      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. ABOUT THE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This privacy policy applies for processing of personal data when we
        process personal data in the capacity of data controller, for instance
        related to personal data about prospective students, visitors of our
        websites, and contact information of contact persons at education
        providers.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This privacy policy does not cover instances where we act as a data
        processor, processing personal data on behalf of an education provider,
        or when the education provider itself acts as a controller for the
        relevant processing of personal data. This is the case when the relevant
        education provider communicates with prospective students, enrolls them
        into programs, courses, or activities, or otherwise manages and stores
        their data using our CRM platform after we have facilitated the initial
        connection. In these situations, the respective education provider is
        the independent data controller, and we advise you to read the privacy
        policy of the respective education provider for details on their
        processing of personal data.
